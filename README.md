# GAE
MATLAB source code to implement the graph-based atrial activity extraction algorithm in [1].

Please install the graph signal processing toolbox before running the code. The toolbox can be download at https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/ .

By running "main.m", you will see the plots of the synthetic pure atrial activity, ventricular activity, mixed EGM, and the extracted atrial activity.
